# Installation

To use the [miner package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/miner),
you'll need a Minecraft server that is using the
[RaspberryJuice](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/raspberryjuice)
plugin. You can [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org) to set up your own
server, even locally on your machine. The installation process doesn't
take too long, but it helps to have some _command line_ experience.
