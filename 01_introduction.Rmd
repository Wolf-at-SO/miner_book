# Introduction

[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) is awesome fun, especially in
creative mode, where you can build all sorts of crazy stuff. But
ambitious building projects can be really tedious to create by hand.
With the [miner R package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/miner), you
can write [R](https://www.r-project.org) code to manipulate your
Minecraft world and create even more awesome stuff.


## Installation

To use the [miner package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/miner),
you'll need a Minecraft server that is using the
[RaspberryJuice](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/raspberryjuice)
plugin. You can [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org) to set up your own
server, even locally on your machine. The installation process doesn't
take too long, but it helps to have some _command line_ experience.
